# ðŸ§Š SLIVER Laser Logger

## Highlights

- Set-up, processing, and logging sketch for the GPS-integrated LiDAR unit. 
- Script for linking SLIVER data with the on-board OGRE. 

## Overview

The SLIVER (Summit Land-Ice Validation of Elevation Retrievals ) logger is intended to measure geodetic-grade GNSS positions with respect to the snow surface, and surface roughness. The positioning is based on an industrial automation laser distance sensor, the SICK DMT10-1111S01. The SICK unit does all time-of-flight processing internally, and passes a raw distance through the serial port at 34,800 baud, as fast as it can. To log the data in a meaningful way, an Arduino microcontroller is connected with a combined GPS and data logging shield. This contains a real-time-clock (RTC) with which to tag the laser distance data; the RTC gets set by the on-board nav-grade GPS receiver, and thus the laser data can later be syncronized with the OGREâ€™s geodetic GNSS data. The laser data are logged to a microSD card in a simple text format. Two 12 volt batteries provide 12 V for both the Arduino and OGRE and 24 V for the SICK laser. An in-box charger allows for charging before the traverse. The whole Nanuk case is designed to be mounted to the side of the PolyPod sled.
